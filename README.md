# Randomly Generated

This project demonstrates the use of **K-Means Clustering** to group a dataset that has been randomly generated using the `scikit-learn` library. The project highlights the process of data generation, clustering, and visualization of the clustered data points.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are:
- To generate a random dataset using `make_blobs` from `scikit-learn`.
- To apply **K-Means Clustering** to group the data points into distinct clusters.
- To visualize the clustered data for a better understanding of the clustering outcome.
